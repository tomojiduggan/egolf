From Cosmic Dreams to Electromagnetic Realities Once upon a hackathon, a group of bright-eyed physics and CS enthusiasts gathered around a whiteboard. 

Our initial brainstorm ideas were as wild as they were ambitious. Gravitational lensing simulation? A dazzling concept, but not quite interactive enough. Training an AI to achieve balance for a double pendulum? Super cool, but a tad too ambitious given our sleep-deprived state.

After some spirited debate (and probably a few caffeine-fueled tangents), we settled on something both challenging and achievable: an **Electromagnetic Golf Game**. Because who doesnâ€™t love combining charged particles, physics, and, of course, golf?

But seriously, we are four physics students, baring the name of __Team Lorentz Legend___ that happens to be taking E&M classes together, which is what leads us to this projects.

## So What is E&M Golf?
The good old nice golf game... Everyone's childhood favorites, has made a return! But with a Twist! Instead of playing as a golf ball affected by gravity and friction, this time you found yourself being a electron, interacting with the seemingly mysterious electric and magnetic field, and avoiding the dangerous positron!

Don't be frightened! This is your opportunity to learn about E&M through visualization and, of course, ultimately reaching the goal. 

__To try it out, clone this git repository and double click on main2.py to start exploring!__

## Design Philosophy
This project is aimed to teach people with little knowledge of E&M in a fun and interactive way, we have added visualizing options for the electric and magnetic field, and while playing it, we allow the player to change all stationary charges from electron to positrons to explore the effect of how field is created. 

We also believe that it is best to let user to play with custom levels, so we partially implemented a custom level editor. After placing all the props, press save and it will create a __custom_level.json__ file, rename it to __level(1-6).json__ in the __levels__ folder to test it out yourself.

## Challenges
Our group's main challenge is learning the library __pygame__. For all members in our group, it is the first time for us using it. Some other challenges include
- Time constraint, coding a game in a Hackathon is very time consuming, e.g. designing level and sprites. But we are really proud of what we end up with.
- Coding our own physics engine.
- Coding logic for perfectly elastic collision.
- Implementing the custom level editor (dragging objects).
- Visualizing the E and M field.
- Designing levels.
## Technologies Used
Python, Pygame, Numpy, ProCreate.
